# Live cryptocurrency info ðŸ¤‘

## Title
An app that displays live cryptocurrency data using ws://prereg.ex.api.ampiy.com/prices websocket allows users to access real-time updates on cryptocurrency prices. The app utilizes a websocket connection to a specific endpoint to receive updates as they happen, rather than periodically requesting the data. This is useful for traders or investors who need to make quick decisions based on current market conditions. Additionally, using websockets reduces the load on the server and can improve the efficiency and scalability of the app. This app can also be used by developers and researchers to access live data for their analysis and research.
## Steps to run this project

- Clone the app in your code editor
- Run the app on emulator or a physical device
